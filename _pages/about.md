- A platform for undergraduates to understand more about the field of IPE and its relation to developments (past/present) in the global political economy
- For undergraduates keen to specialise in IPE, the platform can be a community to connect with like-minded undergrads (since there is no formal IPE specialisation at NUS) with the (possible) aim for to create a conducive community for learning from one another and collaboration on research projects and written pieces 
- Contribution to the platform:
  - Targeted at developing one’s interest in IPE (based on their academic interest) which might not be possible through academic modules (can be in preparation for an ISM/HT/project related to mods)
  - The space and opportunity to take charge of one’s personal research project/collaborate with others on anything IPE-related at an undergrad level 
  - Additional resources to understanding contemporary political-economic developments in the world today
